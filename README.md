## The Document creator and displayor. 
AMPDocumentor005.html lets you create 'staggered'  curriculum/topic/lesson records of chatty generations.
AMPDocumentDisplayor005.html.html then display them with the displayer
### Usage: export the JSON from the documentor, and then past the JSON to the displayer. 
#### Sometimes the last section is hidden, so you have to create 2 sections, unfold both, then edit the top of the 2, and delete the last 1. a bit of a process. 

## LifeOS the Life Scheduler
Well... you edit the html page to add a curriculum, but it works like the Japanese style of creating a car... kanban style. God_Jesus bless Risen_Jesus!!  

## TemporalNexus - project organizer . 
Gemini came up with the name 'temporal nexus' which just lets you create a project on the 'right side' and then detail your project with commits, on the left side.
### Usage
left click on a node, then right click and select from the menu. 
### Todo 
integrate with ollama/api/embed for more annoying times when AI envisions you doing a hundred projects... 

## chat turn archiver
Let's you archive the chat, as it stands in 2025. Useful for when those pesky subscriptions time out and ChatGPT wipes your workspace and access.  Download works, or the other export works. 

Keep trying until you are sure you have saved something.
